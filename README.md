# AdventureWorks Sales Analysis

The project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of sales data, customer demographics, and product details to uncover complex relationships and provide sophisticated insights. These insights will facilitate the development of more effective sales strategies, refined product offerings, and targeted marketing campaigns, ultimately driving sustained growth and customer satisfaction.

# Problem Statement:

During the cause of the analysis, the key issues to be addressed are: what is the relationship between higher product prices with lower sales quantities, how does sales performance vary significantly across different territories and is sales higher for certain product categories due to seasonal trends.

# Methodology

Data Acquisition: Dataset used was provided by 3Signet

Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was conducted using Python to gain insights into the relationships between different variables.

Visualization: Visualizations was created using Power BI.

Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was done between different variables.

Time Series Analysis: Trends across period was done to understand seasonality of the dataset.

Dashboard Creation: Interactive dashboards in Power BI was created to provide users with pictorial representation of the dataset.

# Recommendations:
Based on the analysis conducted, the following recommendations are proposed:

- The analysis shows that no. of children impacts the spending power of customers, so we can target customers with no child or less children to increase the chances of sales.
- The top 3 regions (Australia, Southwest, Northwest) should be focused on and ads targeting the right audience should be done even before the peak period, this will increase the chances of repurchase amongst customers.
- Customers prefer the small and medium sizes, so production should focus more on these sizes to ensure maximum sales. The same analogy applies to black-coloured shirts. 
- More of the black-coloured products should be produced than white or other colours. This ensures that customers‚Äô wants and needs are duly met.
- Income directly affects purchasing power and analysis has shown that the type of education level a customer has will strongly influence their income, which will in turn influence their spending capacity. For products that are expensive like Road-150 Red, we can target those to the Graduate degree and Bachelors, and then the cheaper products like Patch kit, Road Tire Tube and Touring Tire Tube to the Partial High school certificate holder and High School certificate holder. This way, customers can easily get what‚Äôs within their budget, in return increasing sales probability.
- The revenue from the least performing products, especially the Racing Socks brand products, is quite low, increasing the publicity around those products, a buy-one-get-one free promo could be implemented or upselling during customer purchase of any products. 

# Conclusion:

Sales is impacted by a lot of factors like Income, Education Level, order quantity, price, region and no of children, therefore leveraging proper profiling of each customer will help in targeting and understanding each customer‚Äôs needs and preferences which in turn will impact revenue positively.
